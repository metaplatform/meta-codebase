## Fragment lifecycle

Fragment's life is divded into `created`, `ready`, `resumed` and `paused` states.

### Created state

Fragment state is set to created when:

- All modules are imported
- Fragment model has been initialized
- onCreate handler has been called
- In this state view property is not available yet.

Fragment element visibility css property is set to hidden.

### Ready state

Fragment state is set to ready when:

- View has been materialized (but not rendered yet)
- All child fragments has been created (but not ready and not resumed yet)
- In this state child fragment properties should be set - provider binding for example.

### Resumed state

Fragment state is set to resumed when `fragmentElement.resume` method has been called.

**Resume cycle:**

1. If fragment is resumed at first time then fragment's css property visibility is set to visible.
2. Resume all child fragments and wait until they all are resumed
3. Call onResume handler - now view property is available
4. Call fragmentElement.resume method's callback

In this cycle and in `onResume` handler we should initialize content providers, bind to their notifications and do other manual binding if neccesary.

If auto attribute has been set to meta-fragment element then fragment will be automatialy resumed right after it's initialization.

### Paused state

Fragment state is set to paused when fragmentElement.pause method has been called or when fragment node has been dettached from DOM.

**Pause cycle:**

1. Unbind all fragment's view template events
2. Pause all child fragments
3. Call onPause handler

In this cycle and in `onPause` handler we should unbind all events which has been bound to content providers and other stuff. It is because when fragment is not active anymore (maybe beacause of dettaching from DOM) we don't wont to react on changes and update view anymore.
