## Libraries

During META Platform development we created various libraries and JavaScript modules.

- [META Doc]($base$/libraries/meta-doc/) - documentation generator used to create this site
- [META Logger]($base$/libraries/meta-logger/) - JavaScript logging library with support of facilities and multiple transports
- [META Shared storage]($base$/libraries/meta-shared-storage/) - JavaScript library which provides synchronized key-value storage
