## Microservices architecture

After few years of working on other projects and experimenting we decided to use microservices architecture.

**Monolithic applications**

- Great for desktop
- Difficult to maintain growing code
- Difficult to react on changes
- All components must use same language and interface
- Big point of failure - application crashes and system is down

**Microservices**

- Each application component is a independent service
- Each service is standalone application
- Different services can use different programming languages
- Easier scalability
- Agile friendly
- Durability - when one component crashes others still running
